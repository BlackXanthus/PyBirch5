------- Welcome to PyBirch ----------------------------------

Welcome to PyBirch. A python3 IRC client. It's written simply for fun, and it's
mostly fixed when time presents itself. This will slowly improve over, probably,
months. Eventually this will be released, if all the things for moving to Beta
are ever fulfilled. That's a long, long way off. This text is mostly here
just to fill up the About window's box, so that there's actually something
in there. 

Blow you will find the things that have been done, as well as known bugs, and
things that are being fixed for each version. If you find a bug that is not
listed, please let me know.

Missing functionality is not a bug. It's something we will get around too
as soon as possible, or when it annoys me that it's not in the code. 


------- Setting Information ---- 

The config file for py-Birth is py-birch.cfg. Not all of the settings currently
show up in the properties dialogue. 

The config file is in .ini format (currently), and can be edited by hand, if you know
what your doing. Below are all of the sections, and their defaults.

------- Coding Notes -----------

- A change to fix the nicklist problem, using .lower() seems to have affected tab-complete
- It seems that not all nicks are being added on channel join to the nicklist

--------Goals for Beta Release--------------
- Channel Logging : Simple logging created in plugins (Done ALPHA 0.4.2)
- Disconnection/timeout handled 
--Disconection socket error fixed (Done for 0.4.1 ALPHA), now to fix disconnection by server.
- Menus and buttons working - Done for 0.4 ALPHA
- Disconenct works, and handles channels in some way - ALPHA -0.4.2.1
- /msg creating a new window - DONE 0.2.2.1 ALPHA
- /notice appearing in active? window
- Popup dialog with kick/ban/kickban for individual nicks
- Clear all Major Known Bugs.

##############Known Bugs#####################
-Major - Nick changes are not internally updated properly! - Some work has been done on this, all keys are now in lower-case. May be fixed, but requires monitoring (Alpha 0.4)

-Minor - Not all users are being added to the nick-list. - Marked intermittent : Alpha 0.3 - This may be a subset of the above problem. May be fixed (Alpha 0.4) --Some nicks cannot be tab-completed as a result. - May be linked to the failure to print correct QUIT and PART messages: fixed Alpha 0.4.2.1

- Kick message does not work properly

-Minor - If a user(of the client) is banned, and joins channel, then is subsequently unbanned, the channel does not appear, and out put is piped to the status window.

- Minor - if the windows is minimised, and text added, window does not scroll (therefore, window does not scroll minimised) - Found: ALPHA 0.4

- Minor - following a disconnect, PART messages are still sent to a server when the channels close. Introduced - ALPHA 0.4.2.1 

###########Items ToDo###################

- Make the config creation/checking routines more robust. 
-- Config is currently *created* in IrcConnection, Channels, and ServerOutputSorter. === Check the status of this... 
- Add Server name to the status window
- Get icons. 
- Ensure user input works: Currently working: /me /msg 
- Add Connect To, to allow the changing of server.
---Works intermitently, but better than it did before.
- Fix multiple +oo and +vv nick changes.
- Context menu has been added for nicklist. Now it just needs to do something
- Erros when trying to remove the Program User from a channel they've left.- Found in ALPHA 0.4.1
- Print Full Configuration, even unused settings


#################Partially Complete#####################

- It seems that the lines are stripping spaces out. Fix this. - Marked intermittent - Alpha 0.3
- KICK does not properly remove a user from the window. - Found in 0.2.2.1 ALPHA - Partial Fix Alpha 0.3
- Add Colour to incomming text - some done for Alpha 0.2.1
- Due to a bug? in the way python clears variables, TextString is not properly cleared between loops. This means the last values in it are used for unrecognised strings. - Possibly fixed : Alpha 0.2.1 

-------Done for PyBirch 0.5 ALPHA (unreleased to the public)
- Moved to PyQt5 for the GUI elements. 
--This has meant re-implenting the actions, connections, as well as working without a simple
  way to design the GUI, until such time as QtDesigner is updated. This includes an updated Properties
  dialogue (mostly working), and updating a lot of connections that have been lagging. 
- Added the basic type-history to the client (up and down arrow moves through it)

------Done for PyBirch 0.4.2.2 ALPHA (Unreleased to the public)(Mostly Stable)

-------Done for PyBirch 0.4.2.1 ALPHA (Unreleased to the public)
- More Color choices added (J/P/Q now all have their own colour options)
- Quit messages now appearing in channel window with better frequency. (Note: part messages, and kick messages are appearing twice). 
- /msg and /me are now colourised
- /msg now works as expected.
- Disconnect now properly ends the thread. Errors cleaned up from text window.
- Fix "Disconnect" button/menu command to allow it to re-connect after diconnection - Fixed in ALPHA 0.4.2.1
--Handles channels, in that they close on disconnect. Has introduced minor bug that the client still sends
  PART messages, producing a "disconnected from IRC, please reconnect" error message. - ALPHA 0.4.2.1
- Minor - Nick Already In Use dialogue appears twice. Cancel (or close) sends information to the server. - Fixed in ALPHA 0.4.2.1 
- Host names for nicks are now stored in the Nicklist database. 
- Channel is now sent the TextString (rather than the displayString) in order to improve processing of information.
- PyQt4 and PyQt5 version branches divided here.

-------Done for PyBirch 0.4.1 ALPHA (unreleased to the public)
- Basica plugin system created. 
-- Simple Loggin Plugin made.


-------Done for PyBirch 0.4.1 ALPHA (unreleased to the public)

- Disconnect error messages cleared (except QTimer message)

--------Done for PyBirch 0.4 ALPHA (unreleased to the public)
- Menus working. About shows this text file.
- Status window is now a subset of Channel. This means Status now responds to colour/font changes etc. 
- Nick Already In Use Dialogue now implemented.
	- Bug : This dialogue appears twice

	- Bug : pressing Cancel sends information to the server. 

--------Done for PyBirch 0.3.1 ALPHA (unreleased to the public)

  available on system.

--------Done for PyBirch 0.3 ALPHA (unreleased to the public)

- Tab-complete now case-insensitive

--------Done for PyBirch 0.2.2.1 ALPHA (unreleased to the public)

  from inside the channel.

- +v/-v operations now adjust nicklist immediately, rather than after a delay.

- Ensured NickLists are sorted in order
