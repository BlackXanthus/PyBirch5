# PyBirch5
A Python / Qt5 based IRC Client

Written by BlackXanthus, 2020

This is a (mostly) functional Python-based IRC client - built from scratch. 

This is a project that was designed to help develop my understanding of Python, and this program has now become my daily driver for IRC. 
Features are added as I feel they are needed, and bugs are fixed when they get to irritating. If you want to help drive the development of PyBirch, 
simply pop a bug request, or report an issue, or feature improvement, and I'll see what I can do. 

If you are enjoying this client, please do let me know.
